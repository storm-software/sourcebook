 ## External packages — DO NOT PATCH

The following Storm Software ecosystems are maintained in **separate repositories**. Do **not** modify their package code, vendored scaffolding, or `node_modules` contents in this repo — including via `patch-package`, manual edits under `node_modules`, or direct changes to generated integration layers.

| Ecosystem | Upstream repository | In this repo (do not patch) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **powerlines** | [storm-software/powerlines](https://github.com/storm-software/powerlines) | `powerlines`, `@powerlines/*`, and Powerlines-generated CLI scaffolding |
| **power-plant** | [storm-software/power-plant](https://github.com/storm-software/power-plant) | `@power-plant/*` and any power-plant schema or tooling packages |
| **shell-shock** | [storm-software/shell-shock](https://github.com/storm-software/shell-shock) | `@shell-shock/*` and `apps/cli/.shell-shock/` |
| **mindctl** | [storm-software/mindctl](https://github.com/storm-software/mindctl) | `@mindctl/*` and the mindctl CLI |
| **razorwind** | [storm-software/razorwind](https://github.com/storm-software/razorwind) | `@razorwind/*` |
| **cyclone-ui** | [storm-software/cyclone-ui](https://github.com/storm-software/cyclone-ui) | Consumer configuration and integration owned by this repo (for example `powerlines.config.ts`, `razorwind.config.ts`, `shell-shock.config.ts`, `tools/razorwind/`, and cyclone-ui CLI command implementations under `apps/cli/src/`) |
| **storm-ops** | [storm-software/storm-ops](https://github.com/storm-software/storm-ops) | Reusable workflows, devenv modules, Terraform modules, and other storm-ops artifacts consumed by reference |

**Current repository exception:** You may make changes to files owned by the current repository, even when that repository appears in the table above. The restriction applies only to external packages and vendored layers whose upstream repository is elsewhere.

**Allowed in this repository:** consumer configuration and integration owned by this repo (for example `powerlines.config.ts`, `razorwind.config.ts`, `shell-shock.config.ts`, `tools/razorwind/`, and cyclone-ui CLI command implementations under `apps/cli/src/`).

When a bug or feature belongs in one of the ecosystems above:

1. **Stop** — do not patch the external package or its vendored layer in this repository.
2. **Produce a descriptive upstream fix outline** so a human or agent can apply the change in the correct external repository.
3. **Optionally** implement only this repository's workaround or configuration change if one exists and is explicitly requested.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
